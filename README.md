# Rust Programming Examples

This repository contains various Rust programming examples. Each example is designed to take user input and perform specific operations. Below are the examples included in this repository:

1. **Check Whether a Given String is a Palindrome**
2. **Return the Index of the First Occurrence of a Given Number in a Sorted Array**
3. **Return the Shortest Word in a String**
4. **Check Whether a Given Number is Prime**
5. **Return the Median of a Sorted Array**
6. **Find the Longest Common Prefix of a Given Set of Strings**
7. **Return the kth Smallest Element in a Given Array**
8. **Return the Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree**
9. **Reverse a String in Rust**
10. **Check if a Number is Prime in Rust (Different Implementation)**
11. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays in Rust**
12. **Find the Maximum Subarray Sum in Rust**

## How to Run

Each example is a separate Rust file. To compile and run any of the examples, follow these steps:

1. Install Rust from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akashdeep-k/rust.git
    cd rust
    ```
3. To run the palindrome checker, navigate to the `1_check_palindrome.rs` file and compile it using `rustc`. Then, execute the compiled binary.

Example:
```bash
rustc 1_check_palindrome.rs
./1_check_palindrome.exe
```
